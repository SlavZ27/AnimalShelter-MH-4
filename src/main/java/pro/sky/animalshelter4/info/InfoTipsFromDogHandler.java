It's nice to go for a walk with her, because she walks well next to her, does not pull a leash, knows how to wear a muzzle and does not run after cats and other animals. She does not suffer from phobias (she is not afraid of harsh sounds, public transport, visits to the vet hospital, other dogs), calmly stays at home alone, does not spoil things. Does not require to be fed first, does not beg, does not steal food from the table. Does not take the place of the owner without permission. He relieves himself only in specially designated places.\n" +
