                    "Deaf cats usually behave like hearing relatives and do not feel inferior. If the animal does not feel danger, then it behaves friendly and loyal. The task of the owner of a special cat is to ensure her complete safety and learn to communicate. A deaf cat does not hear, but at the same time perfectly captures vibrations and vibrations. However, keep in mind that your silent appearance in the room will scare the animal. A similar reaction will be caused by sharp fluctuations in sounds. Because so that the cat is not scared of your approach, start stomping harder from afar. Do not go to her from behind â€“ try to get into the field of view of the pet before approaching. Behave the same way if you intend to stroke. The cat should see the hand that is approaching her and only then feel the touch. If an animal is constantly attacked unexpectedly, then it will become aggressive, will begin to fight back. When communicating with a deaf animal, attract his attention with loud claps or banging on the floor. The cat will catch the vibrations and understand where they are coming from. If in this case the pet ignores you, this is a conscious choice. Inventive owners of deaf cats attract the attention of their pets with light signals, for example, including a small flashlight." +
                    "Blind cats\n" +
                    "It may seem that a cat's lack of vision will become a strong obstacle to its full-fledged life, but a blind pet adapts to this problem quickly enough and begins to use hearing and smell to orient itself in the environment. For such a pet, it is very important to ensure a safe environment: first of all, carefully inspect the apartment, remove all protruding objects that can injure the cat, fence the stairs, close the hatches and pits in the courtyard of a private house and remove all wires. To make it easy for the dog to navigate at home, you can use narrow carpet paths along which the pet will walk to its place, to the bowl, to the doors. Make sure that when you leave the house, the cat stays in a safe place.\n" +

                    "The absence of a paw, paralysis of limbs and other health problems do not take away from cats their curiosity and cheerfulness. Such pets need special care, but otherwise such dogs are no different from those who run on four paws.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "It is a mistake to believe that an animal that is restricted in movement due to health problems has no chance of a happy life. Often, some cats can move around the apartment with a spinal gait, i.e. the hind legs walk reflexively and are not controlled by the brain. Of course, the back half of the cat moves clumsily, with a strong amplitude, but this is not so important, because the pet goes on its own. With a spinal gait, the hind legs are rarely injured, but cat owners should be on the alert, and if abrasions are detected, socks should be put on the paws." +
                    "\n" +
                    "In general, the upbringing of such cats is no different from that used for healthy pets. It is only important for the owner to properly distribute the load on the animal so that the pet does not get tired during a walk, game or workout.\n"+
